# React Hooks Formularios

## Planning

- Uncontrolled forms
- Controlled forms

- uncontrolled: In most cases, we recommend using Controlled Components to implement forms.
- In a controlled component, the form data is handled by a React component.
- The alternative is uncontrolled components, where the form data is handled by the DOM itself.
- To write an uncontrolled component, you can use a reference to get the form values from the DOM.
